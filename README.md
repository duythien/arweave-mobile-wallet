### Version  to build app

```sh
$ node -v
v14.17.4
$ yarn -v
1.22.11
$ npm -v
6.14.14

```

### Running your React Native application
First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Metro "takes in an entry file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies."—Metro Docs

```sh
yarn install
npx react-native start
```
Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

```
npx react-native run-ios

```
You should see your new app running in the iOS Simulator shortly.
